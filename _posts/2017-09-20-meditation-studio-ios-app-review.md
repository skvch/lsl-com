In our busy lives, mindfulness has become an indispensable option to cope with everyday stress, clarify our cognitive abilities and generally calming our busy minds.

Luckily there are some great (and sometimes free) utilities right at our fingertips. Whether we are just getting started or already an expert, we can get up and running fairly quickly with the use of an app right in our mobile phone.

When you first open the app, your experience begins on the Meditations screen which are classified by Collection by default. There is also a handy dropdown to filter the meditations by Collection, Teacher, Duration and Type.  

Once tapping on the selected meditation, the meditation audio will begin to play with the sound of guided, soft spoken words. There is also a handy option to play Background Sounds if you like, by clicking on the waveform in the upper right. This option is defaulted to None.
