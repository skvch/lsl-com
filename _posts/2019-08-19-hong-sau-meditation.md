description: Instructions for practicing Hong-Sau meditation.

<p>
This ancient meditation helps bring calm and focus to your day, and can also be used as precursor to other meditations or exercise. 
</p><p>
Hong-Sau is Sanskrit for <i>“I am Spirit”</i> or <i>“I am He”</i>.
</p><p>
Find a quiet place, face eastward, and sit comfortably with a straight spine (for example Sukhasana). Breath normally and relax.
</p><p>
Close your eyes and focus on the midway point between your eyebrows. From that focused third-eye center, mentally observe the natural ebb and flow like a calm ocean of the body’s breath. Don’t interfere or force the breath in or out, just sit as a detached observer watching the body’s breath go in an out. If it helps with detachment, pretend you are observing another person breathing.
</p><p>
As the breath slowly comes into the body, mentally say “Hong” (which rhymes with song), and as the breath exhales out, mentally say Sau (rhymes with saw). Your mouth or tongue should not move, it’s a mental sound. Hear the sound of Hong and Sau literally coming from the breath wind. This ebb and flow should feel natural.
</p><p>
As you begin to feel a deeper calm, feel the breath higher and higher in the nose. If your mind wanders, it’s ok, just bring your attention back to the awareness of the breath and the sound of the words Hong Sau. 
</p><p>
Continue to observe the breath and the sounds of the mantra; the repetitions flowing in and out, allow yourself to feel serenity. Continue as you long as you feel comfortable.
